# Pulumi + Aspire

A prototype using pulumi and aspire together for local development. The pulumi automation API is used at runtime to provision azure resources and flow outputs to locally running projects.

This requires a [daily build](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/main/docs/using-latest-daily.md) of .NET Aspire.
